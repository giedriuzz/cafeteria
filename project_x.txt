Cafeteria project : Create an live menu and payment system (a.k.a console program):

[] First the program should ask if table was reserved/ not (Providing your full name).
[] And then if not would assign you a table (there is a specific number single,
    double or family tables).
[] After table is assigned to you, system should show how many free tables are and
    how which are reserved/occupied. 
[] The system must be able to show name/surname of the person of the reserved table 
    (CLI option : enter reserved table number ; OUTCOME: Name/Surname/Time Reserved)
[] After assigning table, system should show different menu options for breakfast,
    lunch , dinner , drinks (alcohol. alcohol free), to choose from. 
[] Special menu for vegetarian and vegan must be included too in the special menu.
[] All menu items should have weight, preparation time in minutes, calories, and price.
[] I have to have an option to change the order before the payment section.
        [] Thus I can delete,
        [] add more,
        [] update amount of the same order.
[] I should be able to choose whatever I want from all menus in one ordering.
[] After I finish, I need to see what I chosen, the full payable amount and approx
    waiting time for the food to be served
[] Add an option to add tips (% from the full cost) to the final bill.
[] After the payment , system should generate the receipt (logging).

[] In github write README.md file
